# Black Arch Utils

Following the arch linux's philosophy (only install the packages we need), this guide will help you to install the black-arch repos for pentesting or hacking proposes.

> Note: This action is NOT going to install ALL blackarch packages (+4G) This just allow you to install them !

## Black Arch Repo

Enter to the ```.repos``` directory which we were created before
```
cd  ~/.repos
```

Then, create a new directory called ```black-arch``` and enter in
```
mkdir black-arch && cd black-arch
```

Generate the ```strap.sh``` running
```
curl -O https://blackarch.org/strap.sh
```

Give it permission for execution
```
chmod +x strap.sh
```

Finally we execute the file
```
sudo ./strap.sh
```

And voilÃ , if you want to check all was ok, tape
```
sudo pacman -Sy
```
> We are supposed to have the following result
> ```
> :: Synchronizing package databases...
>  core is up to date
>  extra is up to date
>  community is up to date
>  blackarch is up to date**
> ````
> So, now we'll be able to install any black arch util !
